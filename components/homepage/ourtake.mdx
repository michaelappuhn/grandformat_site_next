## Our Take

### In 2026, every company is a tech company.
Technology is an essential core of companies of every size. Marketing, product development, distribution, and operations are all facilitated by digital tools.

### Technology is powerful. And really hard.
The primary “disruption” of the online era has been a breadth of distribution, coupled with ease-of-access. The internet is the grandest format in history, but it takes effort, skill, and luck to unlock its’ power.

### The hardest problems are [wicked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem).
Every company is more complex than it seems. The biggest opportunities lie between the details (what we build, how), the big picture (the business, its’ context).
