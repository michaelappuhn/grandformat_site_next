## How we work

### Right-sized teams
#### A business model designed for cost efficiency

We’re more like a “general contractor” for innovation: project-based teams, scaled up and down by need.

While innovation studios have bloated teams, overhead — maybe even a VP or two — we keep costs low so that we can work with smaller, non-VC-backed companies and remain profitable. 


### Tech industry veterans

#### Some of the smartest nerds you can find

We build up a trusted project team from a rich tech industry network for the job at hand.

For a given project, this might be engineers, designers, researchers, marketers, data scientists, product people, and more.


### Research-focused, and data-driven

#### Building for the right reasons

We put up-front work into making sure we’re building the right thing. When we’re done building, we verify.


### Small tests versus big scope
#### Built-in iterative process

We optimize for quality work, and long-term relationships by building testable features, and working on those over time.
